# How Node Works ðŸ§ ðŸš€

This repository contains learning experiments and code samples that explain **how Node.js works under the hood**, based on my study of the Node.js internals. It's a collection of core concepts and demonstrations that are essential for understanding the magic behind Node.js.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- âœ… Blocking vs Non-Blocking Code
- âœ… Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code
- âœ… The Event Loop (Call Stack, Callback Queue, Microtask Queue)
- âœ… Callback Functions
- âœ… Event-Driven Architecture
- âœ… Modules & The require System
- âœ… The Node.js Runtime
- âœ… Timers (`setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `process.nextTick`)
- âœ… File System (fs module) Basics
